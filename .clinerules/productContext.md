# Product Context: Quran Expo Web App

## Purpose & Problem Statement

The Quran Expo Web App exists to increase accessibility to the Quran by bringing the existing iOS native app experience to the web platform. This addresses several key problems:

1. **Platform Limitations**: The native app is only available to iOS users, excluding Android users and those who prefer web-based access.
2. **Installation Barrier**: Native apps require installation, which can be a barrier to quick or one-time usage.
3. **Discoverability**: Web content is more easily discoverable through search engines than native app content.
4. **Shareability**: Web links are more easily shared across platforms and don't require the recipient to install an app.

## User Experience Goals

The web application aims to provide an experience that matches or exceeds the native app in these key areas:

1. **Beauty and Reverence**: The Quran deserves an interface that honors its significance with beautiful typography, thoughtful layout, and respectful design.
2. **Ease of Navigation**: Users should be able to intuitively find and move between Surahs and verses.
3. **Reading Clarity**: Arabic text and translations should be clearly presented with appropriate typography and spacing.
4. **Seamless Audio**: Audio playback should feel natural and integrated, with subtle visual cues indicating playback status.
5. **Performance**: The app should load quickly and respond immediately to user interactions, despite handling rich content and audio.
6. **Accessibility**: Content should be accessible to users with varying needs, including support for screen readers and keyboard navigation.
